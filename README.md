# Playing Catan
This is an almost-complete game of Catan. To play:
*	Download all files, including the images folder.
*	Ruin “main.py”
*	Refer to the diagram.png for numbered location of board components.
*	Do not close the GUI – it will cause the program to crash when trying to update.
 
### Some notes:
*	For this game, the numbers 6 and 8 can sometimes be next to each other on the board. We know that it’s against the rules of Catan. We just did not get to tell Python about it yet. Go ahead, grab a settlement there!
*	Even if you manage to build the longest road, you will not get points for it. That method has not been created yet. Sorry.
*	But we have something better instead: you can use as many development cards as you wish, no need to buy them! The program does not track your cards yet, but it does complete all actions.

### Happy playing!
